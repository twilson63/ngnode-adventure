# About ngnode Adventure

In this adventure, we will build an AngularJS app using NodeJS and Browserify. The application will be a localstorage todo application, nothing special, but it will give you a way to practice setting up applications using Angular and NodeJS.

In this exercise, all you need to do is learn how to verify your exercises.

To verify an exercise you run the application `ngnode-adventure` followed by the argument `verify` then the filename and/or argument

    ngnode-adventure verify GO
